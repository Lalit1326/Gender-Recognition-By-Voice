Gender Recognition by Voice is a project designed to predict gender based on voice input. Developed with Python and R libraries, this project processes audio samples to make gender predictions. A user-friendly interface was later added to enhance usability.

Features
Voice Input: Allows users to input audio samples.
Gender Prediction: Uses machine learning models to predict gender from voice samples.
User Interface: Provides a graphical interface for easy interaction with the application.
Technology Stack: Python, R, audio processing libraries.
